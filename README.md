# Data-Science-Capstone-Project-Healthcare
The dataset used in this project is originally from NIDDK (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.. The objective is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
Build a model to accurately predict whether the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not.
Dataset Description:
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable (Outcome). Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and more.
Variables	     Description
Pregnancies	     Number of times pregnant
Glucose	         Plasma glucose concentration in an oral glucose tolerance test
Blood Pressure	 Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
Skin Thickness	 Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
Insulin	         Two hour serum insulin
BMI	             Body Mass Index
Diabetes Pedigree Function	Diabetes pedigree function
Age	             Age in years
Outcome	         Class variable (either 0 or 1). 268 of 768 values are 1, and the others are 0
